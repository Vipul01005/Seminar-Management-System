# Seminar-Management-System
The Seminar Management System is a standalone desktop application designed to support the management of a postgraduate academic research seminar. The system enables students to register for the seminar by submitting their research details and presentation materials. Evaluators use the system to assess assigned presentations based on predefined evaluation rubrics and provide structured feedback. Coordinators manage seminar sessions, assign presenters and evaluators, generate evaluation reports, and oversee award nominations. The system improves organization, transparency, and efficiency by centralizing all seminar-related processes into a single, user-friendly platform.
